## Overview
### Description
Social Media App with a focus on uploading memories in the form of images or quotes based on the location (city/country) they were created. Each pin on the map will be a place where the user created memories. This application then takes those memories and allows you to display a recap of your memories posted on the app thus far.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking
- **Mobile:** On the go! Most people are always carrying their phone; it will be easy for people to take a picture and upload it to add to their collection of memories.
- **Story:** Will allow friends to see the memories that their friends created throughout the year. It is a bit more intimate than other social media platforms (most users will probably only add their closest friends).
- **Market:** A way for individuals to keep in contact with close friends and family who they do not see frequently.
- **Habit:** Individuals create memories every day. They will feel driven to add more memories in hopes of having a better and fuller recap.
- **Scope:** There are a lot of small moving parts but I feel as though this app will be feasible. Creating an end of the year video of memories can be a stretch goal, but displaying memories in the form of a recap on the app will be feasible.
